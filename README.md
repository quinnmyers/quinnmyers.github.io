# Purpose
##### This website serves as a personal website to showcase my skills and work.


##Project Stack/Technologies Used:
### Gulp
### Jekyll
### Pug(formerly Jade)/HTML
### SASS

##Design/Vector Assets
### Sketch App


##### If you'd like use the same development environment as I did for this project, please head over to my [gjps_stack repository](https://github.com/quinnmyers/gjps_stack) and clone it for your own use. Follow the instructions on the repositories README for installation instructions.

##### The project environment is based off shakyShanes  [repository](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync), I only changed a few things and also "cleaned it up", meaning, it won't come with all the stock blog-friendly things a normal jekyll site comes with. I do not take credit for writing the original gulp files etc, I just used his.

##### My repository comes ready to use Pug (formerly Jade) for your HTML and also has a prettify function to prettify the output HTML if you choose to do so.
